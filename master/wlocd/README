This is a very small and very simple daemon that does nothing more than run with
root privileges. Whenever a client connects to it, it evaluates the current WLAN
data, sends them back to this client and closes the connection. This gives the
possibility to use libwlocate under Linux with low user privileges but still with
full access to all WLAN information. The wlocd daemon itself is very simple, no
special protocol is used, the WLAN data structure is just sent back (so when
somebody else connects to this daemon the response will consist of unusable
binary data).
Because wlocd does not receive anything and act on 127.0.0.1 only, there may be
absolute no way to exploit or to crack it somehow in order to get its root
privileges. So it is no security risk when this daemon is running with root
privileges all the time.
libwlocate itself knows how to handle wlocd, every request for getting position
information is issued to the wlocd first in order to get the WLAN data. Only in
case there is now wlocd running or there is nor usable response from it, wlocd
tries to get these data directly.
