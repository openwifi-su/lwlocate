This is a demo application that makes use of libwlocate. It uses this library
to get the current geographic position, then downloads the related map tiles
from the OpenStreetMap project (please refer to http://www.openstreetmap.org 
for detail) and displays them within the main screen. The calculated geographic
position is highlighted with a red circle. Its radius differs and depends on
the quality of the returned location result.

This application uses the wxWidgets toolkit (from http://www.wxwidgets.org )
for the user interface. To compile it from source the related wxWidgets
development files are required.
