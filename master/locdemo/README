This is a demo application that makes use of libwlocate. It uses this library
to get the current geographic position, then downloads the related map tiles
from the OpenStreetMap project (please refer to http://www.openstreetmap.org 
for detail) and displays them within the main screen. The calculated geographic
position is highlighted with a red circle. Its radius differs and depends on
the quality of the returned location result.

Additionally it can be used to load a libwlocate.trace file as generated by the
command line tool lwtrace to track the positions where a user has been. This
file contains WLAN data which are converted to geographic positions by LocDemo.
These positions form a path that are drawn into the LocDemo map. This function
can be used to track positions a user has been.

This application uses the wxWidgets toolkit (from http://www.wxwidgets.org )
for the user interface. To compile it from source the related wxWidgets
development files are required.
