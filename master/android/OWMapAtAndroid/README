To build this app libwlocate is required. Either use it as library (.jar to be added to
the project) or set a symlink from
libwlocate/master/android/LocDemo/src/com/vwp/libwlocate/ into
libwlocate/master/android/OWMapAtAndroid/src/com/vwp/ (so that there is a directory
"libwlocate" in folder "src/com/vwp/" afterwards.

Before submitting changes in this App please check if they could be added to
OpenWLANMap@Android app too.
