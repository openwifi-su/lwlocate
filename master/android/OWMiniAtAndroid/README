To build this app libwlocate is required. Either use it as library (.jar to be added to
the project) or set a symlink from
libwlocate/master/android/LocDemo/src/com/vwp/libwlocate/ into
libwlocate/master/android/OWMiniAtAndroid/src/com/vwp/ (so that there is a directory
"libwlocate" in folder "src/com/vwp/" afterwards.

Before submitting changes in this App please implement the same in OpenWLANMap@Android
app.
