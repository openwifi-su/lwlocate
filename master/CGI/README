This directory contains a CGI (common gateway interface application) that can be
used together with a webserver to provide a JSON-based geolocation interface. Such
interfaces are used e.g. by webbrowsers to offer geolocation services for
their users and related to the shown content.
For some webbrowsers the URL can be changed where the geolocation services are
accessible at, here the address of this CGI application has to be given.
