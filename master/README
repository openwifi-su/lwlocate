About
-----

libwlocate is a library that can be used to evaluate a geographical position out of the
WLAN networks that are available near to a user. It is (c) 2010 by Oxygenic/VWP. You can
contact me at virtual_worlds(at)gmx.de but please only in case this README and the
included documentation does not answer your question ;-)
Contributions, feedback and suggestion are always welcome.

****************************************************************************************
* ATTENTION: This is a experimental development preview! At the moment (July 2010) the *
* server may be offline from time to time, in this case every call to the library      *
* WILL FAIL! This will be changed as soon as the project goes online fully. Please     *
* visit http://www.openwlanmap.org for more information!                               *

Intended audience
-----------------

This library does not come with an GUI and offers a programming interface only.
Therefore the intended audience are software developers that want to use this library
out of own applications to provide WLAN-based location services out of their software.

Although there is a small test application that demonstrates the usage principle of the
library I afraid it is more or less useless for people that do not program own
applications.

Licensing
---------

The sources are located in directory libwlocate and are licensed unter the terms of the
GPL. For more details please refer to document COPYING.

Building and usage
------------------

There are several possibilites provided to build the library using different operating
systems and building environments:

Makelib        - file for building the shared library libwlocate.so for Linux using
                 standard "make"
Makefile       - file for building a Linux test application using libwlocate.so and
                 standard make
Makelib.QNX    - file for building the shared library libwlocate.so for QNX using
                 standard "make"; here scanning of WLAN networks is currently not
                 implemented, the compiled library will not work at the moment!
Makefile.QNX   - file for building a QNX test application using libwlocate.so and
                 standard make
libwlocate.dsp - project file for building the shared DLL libwlocate.dll for Windows
                 using Microsoft Visual Studio
libtest.dsp    - Visual Studio project file for building a test application that makes
                 use of the formerly generated libwlocate.dll

The library provides one major function that performs the full location job:

int wloc_get_location()

This function scans the currently available WLAN networks, sends the resulting
information to the server of OpenWLANMap at openwlanmap.org and returns the evaulated
position. Additional information about the quality of the result is given, it uses a
range of 0..100 where 100 is the maximum possible quality and accuracy of the result.
Here 100% means the location can't be evaluated more exact, it does not mean
necessarily that the returned position does not differ by more than a fixed deviation.
So this value is only some kind of probability that tells you if the position is really
near to the given geographic coordinates. The smaller this value is, the bigger the
deviation can be.
The value returned by the function informs about the success of the operation, only
in case WLOC_OK is given, the operation was successful and the returned position data
are valid and can be used.
In all other cases the return value informs about the kind of error that occured
(please refer to libwlocate.h for details).

For a more detailled description of all available library functions, their parameters
and usage please refer to file libwlocate.h, there you can find an inline documentation
for all of them.
