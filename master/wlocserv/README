This directory contains the server application that is connected by libwlocate
whenever it requests a new position that has to be evaluated out of the available
WLAN networks.

This server depends on liboapc which is available at
http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/OpenAPC.git and has to be cloned into the same
directory where the libwlocate-git-tree already resides within.
